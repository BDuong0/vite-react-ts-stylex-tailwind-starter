# Vite + React + TypeScript + StyleX + Tailwind Starter Project

This template is a minimal setup for a React project with Vite made via "npm create vite@latest" and choosing the react-typescript template. For CSS styling, I've also included TailwindCSS and StyleX.

## Styles Built With

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) A utility-first CSS framework with lots of classes to style directly in your markup
- [StyleX](https://stylexjs.com/) The CSS-in-JS framework used by Facebook

### Other Plugins

- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/) Code formatter needed for TailwindCSS's automatic CSS class sorting
- [prettier-plugin-tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/automatic-class-sorting-with-prettier#how-classes-are-sorted) A Prettier plugin for TailwindCSS that automatically sorts classes based on Tailwind's recommended class order.
